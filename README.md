# Introduction
These are the code files for an old school snake game which I made using HTML, SCSs and Javascript.<br>
It is an arcade game in which the player(snake) has to eat apples to grow and the speed of the player increases as it grows.

## Overview
This was a challenge I took to test myself for my javascript logic skills, and it was a great test as it was kinda difficult to figure out how to increase the player(snake) size when it eats an apple and other things.

## My Process
- Made some minimalistic basic UI to write the javascript logic upon
- Wrote some logic in javascript for random spawning of food over the map
- Wrote logic in javascript for collision detection
- Wrote logic in javascript for the player controls
- Wrote logic in javascript to increase the size of the player(snake)
- Tested the game and fixed some bugs
- Made the game UI better
- Added Score functionality
- Added high score functionality using local storage
- Added splash screen
- Added end screen
- Added audio

### Built with
- HTML5 Markup
- Git
- SCSS
- Netlify
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Logic

### What I learnt
- I learnt how to build complex logic in javascript
- I learnt how to use local storage

### Continued Development
- Add game pause functionalily on the click of spacebar
